# Apollo Server/Client, Gatsbyjs, Netlify Template

## The JAM stack https://jamstack.org/

https://using-styled-components.gatsbyjs.org

## Prerequisites

- Node (v8.2.0+)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

Example site that demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites with
[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

## Getting Started (Recommended)

Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of this repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Tyler-Churchill/personal-website-template&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.

### Running Locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop

### Building for Production

When you push and deploy to Netlify, it will automatically build your project for production.

You can test out the production build by running:
```

$ npm run build
$ npm run serve

```
